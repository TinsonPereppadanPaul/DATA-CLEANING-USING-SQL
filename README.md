This project demonstrates data cleaning and preprocessing using MySQL on CSV datasets. The main goal is to transform messy, inconsistent, or incomplete data into a clean, structured format ready for analysis or reporting.

Key operations include:

Handling missing or null values

Normalizing inconsistent date formats

Removing duplicates

Standardizing text fields (trimming whitespace, consistent capitalization)

Joining tables for data enrichment
